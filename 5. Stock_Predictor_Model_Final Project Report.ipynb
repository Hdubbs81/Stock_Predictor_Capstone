    "\n",
    "The stock market plays a crucial role in the global economy, influencing investment strategies, economic policies, and financial stability. With the increasing complexity and volume of financial data, accurate stock market predictions have become more critical than ever. According to the World Bank, global stock market capitalization has seen significant growth, emphasizing the importance of effective market analysis and prediction systems.\n",

    "Despite advancements in data analytics and machine learning, many stock market platforms still lack robust predictive models that can help investors make informed decisions. In this project, we aim to develop a comprehensive stock market prediction system that leverages historical data and advanced machine learning techniques to forecast stock prices accurately."

    "The dataset for this project was downloaded from Kaggle and has been filtered and cleaned to only include 4 beauty and wellness stock data. The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that analyzes vast amounts of beauty and wellness stock data and reacts to market changes much faster than humans, potentially leading to improved trading performance. However, it's important to note that predicting stock prices is inherently challenging due to the complexity and randomness of financial markets. While stock predictor models can provide valuable insights, they are not guaranteed to accurately forecast future prices. It's essential for investors to consider various factors, including market conditions, economic indicators, and company fundamentals, when making investment decisions.\n",

    "### The Three Gates in LSTM\n",
    "Imagine an LSTM unit as a smart memory box that decides what to remember and what to forget. This box has three gates, which act like filters or doors, controlling the flow of information. These gates are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Forget Gate - Cleans up old, unneeded information\n",
    "Input Gate - Decides what new information to add\n",
    "Output Gate - Chooses what part of the current memory to output\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Forget Gate**\n",
    "Purpose: Decides what information to throw away from the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: It looks at the starting hidden state (Short-Term Memory) and the current input and it outputs a number between 0 and 1 using the **Sigmoid Activiation Function** for each piece of information in the cell state. The **cell state** represents the **Long-Term Memory**. The Forget Gate essentially determines what percentage of the Long-Term Memory will be remembered. \n",
    "    - 0 means \"completely forget this\"\n",
    "    - 1 means \"completely keep this\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Input Gate**\n",
    "Purpose: Decides what new information to store in the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: It looks at the previous hidden state (Short-Term Memory) combined with the current input to create a **Potential Long-Term Memory**. The percentage of the Potential Long-Term Memory that is saved (the percentage that the Long-Term Memory will remember) is done utilzing the Sigmoid Activiation Function (the same methodology of the Forget Gate). Additionally, the Tanh Activation Function is used to create a vector of new candidate values, which are the potential values that could be added to the cell state (Long-Term Memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Output Gate**\n",
    "Purpose: Updates the Long-Term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: It first calculates the **Potential Short-Term Memory**. Next, the Sigmoid Activiation Function is again used to calculate the percentage of the potential memory to keep or remember. The Tanh Activation Function is applied to the updated cell state to ensure the output values are between -1 and 1, which stabilizes the values. The result is then multiplied by the percentage of potential memory to remember to get the **New Short-Term Memory**. The Potential Short-term Memory becomes the **New Long-Term Memory** and the starting Long-Term Memory Point for the next LSTM unit. The New Short-Term Memory result becomes the starting hidden state or Short-Term Memory for the next LSTM unit. \n",

    "Sigmoid Activation Function: Used in the Forget Gate, Input Gate, and Output Gate to decide what percentage of information to keep.\n",
